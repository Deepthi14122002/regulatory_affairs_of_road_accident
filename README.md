**Road Accident Data Analysis – README**

**What This Project Is About**:

This project focuses on understanding the causes and impact of road accidents in India’s million-plus cities using real data from 2020. We explored how different accident causes affect the number of deaths and injuries, and used charts to make the insights clear and accessible.

**Project Goal**:

To find patterns in the causes and outcomes of road accidents and present them in a visual and easy-to-understand way — so the information can support traffic safety improvements and better policymaking.

**What’s Covered in the Notebook**:

Loaded and cleaned accident data

Explored accident counts by cause, city, and outcome

Used bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps to show the severity and distribution of incidents

Compared causes like overspeeding, careless driving, etc., with the number of people killed or injured

Highlighted the most dangerous causes based on data

**Key Insights**:

Certain causes, like speeding and reckless driving, lead to more fatalities than others

The majority of accidents were concentrated in a few key cities

Visualizations made it easier to understand which accident types are most deadly

**Tools Used**:

Python

Pandas – for data processing

Matplotlib & Seaborn – for creating charts and graphs

**What You Need**:

Dataset: Regulatory Affairs of Road Accident Data 2020 India.csv
